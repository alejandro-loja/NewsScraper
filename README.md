# NewsScraper
Application that scrapes a website's news and can add comments.
The user can also make comments to the page and also change the contents.
I used an npm package called cheerio to scrape the website cnet.com/news.

## How the site works
- Displayed the list of CNET's special news report articles.
- You can click on the name of the article to land on CNET's website.
- You can add notes/comments in each article on the right
